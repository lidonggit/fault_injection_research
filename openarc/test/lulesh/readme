- LULESH is a more complicated case for directive-based fault injection, since it requires selective function inlining.
- To perform selective inlining, OpenARC provides tinline option; you can find brief description on the tinline option and an example usage in the openarcConf_FTINJ.txt file.

- To compile and run, execute the following:

$ O2GBuild.script
$ make
$ cd bin
$ ./lulesh_serial
